            This website is part of my journey toward <span class="fw-semibold text-decoration-underline">upskilling and learning ASP.NET Core</span>.
            I'm building structured, responsive, and functional web applications with real-world features.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-5 text-center">
            This project includes CRUD operations, model validation, routing, and layout styling. I'm also using
            <span class="fw-semibold">Bootstrap Icons</span>
            <i class="bi bi-bootstrap-fill"></i> and a customized theme from <span class="fw-semibold">Bootswatch</span>
            to enhance the visual design and user experience.

            Every page you see reflects what I'm learning — from Razor syntax and MVC architecture to applying consistent UI patterns.
            I'm continually exploring how to improve both functionality and user interface in ASP.NET Core projects.
